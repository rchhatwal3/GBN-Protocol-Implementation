This project was for my Networks Engineering class and is a way to demonstrate our knowledge of Reliable Data Transfer by implementing the full Go-Back-N (GBN Protocol).  

The implementation is done in GBNHost.py using Python 3.5.2 with a simulated server being made in the Simulator.py file. 

Running the pre-made tests can be accomplished by using:
```
python3 RDTTester.py
```
Where the output will be sent to the log files.
